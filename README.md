Early test http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVgAzGxwNXc
 1. Install Grails
 2. Run command "grails run-app"
 3. Server starts in port 8080 by default and shows an index page. Click WebGL Visualizer to see what is happening ( http://localhost:8080/AIBombahServer/webgl )
 4. Run Client.groovy. It launches 4 threads that connect to the server and start playing (badly)
